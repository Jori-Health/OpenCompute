# Project Notes

## Summary
This is a sample document for testing the hi5 highlight picker.

## Key Findings
- The algorithm works well for structured content.
- Bullet points are often important highlights.

## Results
Our testing shows that the scoring system effectively identifies the most relevant content.

## TODO Items
- Add more test cases
- Improve error handling

## Additional Notes
This line is quite long and should score well due to its length being within the optimal range for readability and comprehension.

SHORT LINE

This is another good candidate because it ends with a period and has a reasonable length that falls within our scoring criteria.

â€¢ This bullet point uses a different bullet character and should also score well.

FINAL THOUGHTS - THIS LINE IS ALL CAPS AND SHOULD BE PENALIZED

The final result shows that our implementation works as expected.

# Goal
Build a tiny, offline agent that reads a .txt/.md file and emits the top 5 “highlight” lines with reasons and line-number citations.

# Non-Goals
No LLMs, no network, no dependencies beyond basics. Deterministic.

# I/O
Input: --path <file.txt|md>
Outputs:
1) highlights.json  → array of {rank:int, line_no:int, text:str, reason:str}
2) highlights.md    → checklist with line refs

# Determinism
- Sort ties by (score desc, line_no asc).
- Treat CRLF/LF uniformly; strip trailing spaces; preserve original line text.

# Scoring rubric (add constants in code, but keep behavior exact)
+1 if line ends with period `.`
+1 if contains any keyword (case-insensitive): {summary, key, result, finding, todo}
+1 if starts with bullet (`- ` or `• `)
+1 if 40 ≤ len(line) ≤ 160
−1 if line is ALL CAPS (letters only)
Ignore empty/whitespace-only lines.

# Selection
Compute score for each line. Keep top 5 after scoring; produce reasons listing matched criteria (e.g., "bullet; len=72; keyword=result").

# UX
CLI: hi5 pick --path <file>
Logs: one summary line (total_lines, candidates, selected).

# Testing
- Smoke test on small sample.
- Determinism test: same input → same JSON.

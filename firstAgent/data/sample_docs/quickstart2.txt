Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning (ML) enables computers to learn patterns from data without explicit programming.

Types of ML:
- Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns
- Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error

Common algorithms include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.

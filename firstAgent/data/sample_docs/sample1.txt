Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on algorithms and statistical models. These systems can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled training data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labels
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment

Popular ML algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest

Applications of ML span across various industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft heavily invest in ML research and development.

The field continues to evolve rapidly with advances in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision technologies.
